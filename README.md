# IntelliBreeze

![image info](graphics/logo.jpeg)

## Introduction

Our product is a smart fan system that is capable of providing optimal comfort in various environments. Our product has the unique capability of adjusting the fan speed based on the surrounding temperature ensuring a pleasant atmosphere. With a user-friendly interface, it allows the user to remotely customise, based on their preferences, the temperature measurement units, preferred fan speed, and preferred temperature.

The sensors attached to our smart fan provide temperature and energy consumption analytics to the user through our pocket-friendly app. Additionally, the system will notify the user upon any adjustments in the fan speed. Together, this allows the user to stay informed about their environment and the state of the fan, promoting control over their usage.
