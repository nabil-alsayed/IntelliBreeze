## Introduction

Our product is a smart fan system that is capable of providing optimal comfort in various environments. Our product has the unique capability of adjusting the fan speed based on the surrounding temperature ensuring a pleasant atmosphere. With a user-friendly interface, it allows the user to remotely customise, based on their preferences, the temperature measurement units, preferred fan speed, and preferred temperature.

The sensors attached to our smart fan provide temperature and energy consumption analytics to the user through our pocket-friendly app. Additionally, the system will notify the user upon any adjustments in the fan speed. Together, this allows the user to stay informed about their environment and the state of the fan, promoting control over their usage.

### Purpose & Benefits

**Mission Statement:** "**Summer is coming!** Do you ever feel drenched in sweat during summer? Do you feel like life will be automated one day and that even the temperature around you will change depending on your preferences?"

Say no more and welcome iSenseCool, which provides an automated ventilation fan cooling system around your room based on your preferred temperatures. Maybe it's mid-December and you live in the Northern Hemisphere, then iSenseCool would always be ready for that one lucky hot day in December to cool you off.

Or maybe you live down South, where the summer is at its peak and the system is ready to handle even the hottest temperatures. Then join us on our journey where we deliver a comfortable environment for you.

These main features are what we deliver when you decide to join the iSenseCool environment:-

**Auto:** Allows for change of threshold on when each state of the fan activates, whether its on off, low, medium or high speeds of the fan.

**Manual:** Allows the fan to be controlled by a toggle button that switches on or off.

**The Display of Temperature and Fan Speed** You can at all times see the temperature and fan speed either when you are looking at the app or you are about to sleep and want a quick glance through the Wio display.

All of these features available to you within one screen only for maximum accessibility.

## Dependencies & Requirements

Here are a couple of things that you will need before moving on to the **Installation Guide** of IntelliBreeze.

- [Wio Terminal](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Wio-Terminal-p-4509.html)
- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
- Any IDE that you use for programming, the one used is [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
- [Grove - Temperature & Humidity Sensor (DHT11)](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-TemperatureAndHumidity_Sensor/)
- [MOSFET Transistor IRF530N](https://www.amazon.se/-/en/IRF530NPBF-IRF530N-0-127ohm-Transistor-Channel/dp/B0BDV8J5QF/ref=sr_1_3?crid=3UJUMYKXZTE0R&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.MWJESM82HU7d9rR4ILDMIHH7-v3n3CVpSa2uNZVN1f4W6_riGE8uMF-czT-HjiOPGvzhnBynddyqaPKgFk84_dcScA9-l32_M1jk3q3Y_q1QTf-__gUxvRVT9LiJhOnsIsHtMGXbXPo3MxW89kc4LEGlmd_RPAX3Vg2slZSLE1zmB7du4E2Qm6AH4QmuY213SqAPRPCzOntmfTlRRWKEsdy6U1iwUWqSGG7AOnlj1UbyrwfM5ftcr8RBrgKFKiSVVmEhzEQSqvI_c2fJCmc_o-viMeE9sK6wwqm8iNjcfzU.Vkp07Hqqmd-fIU9TA1hamBlmXBqw0rm9V_c6IIBT77A&dib_tag=se&keywords=irf530n+mosfet&qid=1723060443&sprefix=IRF530N%2Caps%2C102&sr=8-3) (You can find how a MOSFET transistor works [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/k2nwvg/eli5_how_do_mosfets_work/), or you can use any n-channel MOSFET Transistor.)
- A 12DC fan, the one used here is an [Arctic P12](https://www.arctic.de/en/P12/ACFAN00118A)
- A 12V DC supply, the one used here is [AGM Battery](https://www.clasohlson.com/se/AGM-batteri-12-V/p/36-5459), anything lower than 12V will either twitch the signals and get the fan to work at less than full speed or not even work if its too little. 
- [Male-to-male jumper wires](https://www.amazon.se/AZDelivery-kompatibel-Raspberry-Breadboard-inklusive/dp/B07KKJ69DV?source=ps-sl-shoppingads-lpcontext&ref_=fplfs&psc=1&smid=A1X7QLRQH87QA3), you do not need to buy these ones specifically, as long as its male-to-male jumper wires and its more than a few (I'd say 10+).
